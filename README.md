## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media Queries

### What I learned

I learned a lot about CSS's grid-templates-areas property.

This feature is very versatile and can be used to effortlessly create multiple layouts with the same content.

### Continued development

I would like to focus more on less "hard coding" any sort of element size or spacing. IT will help me create responsive websites that do not overflow/get squished
